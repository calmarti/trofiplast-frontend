**About this app**

**Trofiplast** is a web-based database offering an open online library of worldwide records of anthropogenic debris ingested by biota. It includes the species affected, the area and the year where it was found, as well as the reference where the information was recorded. 
Trofiplast is structured according to three general categories where biota regularly inhabits: seawater, freshwater, and land. A separate category includes laboratory experiments.

The web-database has been developed by Archipelagos, ambiente e sviluppo, Italia and Archipelagos – environment and development organizations under the project “Anthropogenic debris impacts on marine biota and its environment”.
 
This web application has been developed as a voluntary work of the organization members.
