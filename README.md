**Trofiplast** allows for searching a broad database of ingested plastics in animals. The database contains records of worldwide instances of anthropogenic debris ingested by biota, as reported in academic literature as well as in some non-academic sources. It includes the species affected, the area and the year where it was found, as well as the reference where the information was recorded.

The project is still under construction.

**Features to be developed**
 
* Allowing for an user to send her/his own contribution to the database

* Refining the search functionality by including more search criteria
